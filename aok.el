;;; Commentary:

;; search all buffers, all buffers whose filenames have a certain
;; type, or all buffers in a certain mode, with `all-occur',
;; `type-occur', or `mode-occur', respectively.

;;; Code:

(require 'cl)

(defun all-occur (rexp)
  "Search all buffers for REXP."
  (interactive "MRegexp: ")
  (multi-occur (buffer-list) rexp))

;; this one {c}/{sh}ould be a completing read that would read from a
;; predefined list of filetype extensions (without requiring a match).
(defun type-occur (extension rexp)
  "EXTENSION denotes a filetype extension to search.
Run occur in all buffers whose names match this type for REXP."
  (interactive "MExtension: \nMRegexp: ")
  (multi-occur-by-filename-regexp (concat ".*\." extension) rexp))

(defun mode-occur (mode rexp)
  "Search all buffers with major mode MODE for REXP."
  (interactive (list (read-command "Mode: ")
                     (read-string "Regexp: ")))
  (multi-occur (remove-if (lambda (buf)
                            (set-buffer buf)
                            (not (eq major-mode mode)))
                          (buffer-list))
               rexp))
